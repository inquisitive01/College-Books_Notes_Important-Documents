How to ask for referrals on LinkedIn the right way?

Trust me after working 4~5 hrs a day, no one is going to reply to the messages like "please refer me", "I am from Tier 3 college, 5* on Codechef", "Hello?"

Stop! No one cares about your struggle, to be honest. Always be precise and clear with your requirements.

I can't keep replying to all the messages on LinkedIn so I thought of making a reusable template for you guys who aren't sure how to do it the right way.

Hers's the template that has got me to interview at my dream companies :)

Would suggest using this template with the recruiters instead of developers working there for high chances of clearing the screening process quickly.
